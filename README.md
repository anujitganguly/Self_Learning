# Self_Learning

## Collection of questions that I faced in online tests, interviews, blogs, etc. I believe this will help beginners in understanding their programming language in detail.

Currently I am starting with C++ codes only, but slowly I will keep adding solutions in more languages. One can refer to these questions and solve on their own preferable language.

One can gain a lot of confidence by practicing these questions if not become an expert in their repective language.

### QUESTION LIST:-
#### 1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?
        File name: array_1.cpp
#### 2. How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?
        File name: array_2.cpp
#### 3. How do you find the largest and the smallest number in an unsorted integer array?
        File name: array_3.cpp
#### 4. How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?
        File name: array_4.cpp
#### 5. How do you print duplicate characters from a string?
        File name: string_1.cpp
#### 6. How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other?
        File name: string_2.cpp
#### 7. Write a code for Bubble Sort.
        File name: bubble.cpp
#### 8. Write a code for Quick Sort.
        File name: quick.cpp

DISCLAIMER: Many codes are written after taking help from websites like Geekforgeeks, programingz.com, sanfoundry, quora, stackoverflow, etc. It is not exact copy paste, but following websites helped me to understand the concepts in detail and thus I am mentioning them in case it may also help others.
