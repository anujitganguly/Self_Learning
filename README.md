# Self_Learning

## Collection of questions that I faced in online tests, interviews, blogs, etc. I believe this will help beginners in understanding their programming language in detail.

Currently I am starting with C++ codes only, but slowly I will keep adding solutions in more languages. One can refer to these questions and solve on their own preferable language.

One can gain a lot of confidence by practicing these questions if not become an expert in their repective language.

### QUESTION LIST:-
#### 1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?
        File name: array_1.cpp
        
#### 2. How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?
        File name: array_2.cpp
