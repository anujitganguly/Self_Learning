# Self_Learning

## Collection of questions that I faced in online tests, interviews, blogs, etc. I believe this will help beginners in understanding their programming language in detail.

Currently I am starting with C++ codes only, but slowly I will keep adding solutions in more languages. One can refer to these questions and solve on their own preferable language.

One can gain a lot of confidence by practicing these questions if not become an expert in their repective language.

DISCLAIMER: Many codes are written after taking help from websites like Geekforgeeks, programingz.com, sanfoundry, quora, stackoverflow, etc. It is not exact copy paste, but following websites helped me to understand the concepts in detail and thus I am mentioning them in case it may also help others.
